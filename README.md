# Cub3D
This is the second graphics project at [42](42sp.org.br).

### What is cub3D?
Cub3D is a team project at [42](42sp.org.br) that asks us to create a "3D" game engine with [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). This project is inspired by the world-famous 90's game [Wolfenstein 3D](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter#:~:text=First%2Dperson%20shooter%20(FPS),in%20a%20three%2Ddimensional%20space.) ever. The objective of this project is to deep dive into the mathematical concepts behind the [ray-casting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) such as calculating distances, height, sprite locations and field of view to create a projection using primarily [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry).

# Run make so you can build the game
make
# Run the game with one of these maps as an argument
./cub3D assets/maps/rave.cub
./cub3D assets/maps/dust.cub
# Clean output objects with
make fclean
# Well done!
```
